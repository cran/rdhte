Description: Understanding heterogeneous causal effects based on pretreatment covariates is a crucial step in modern empirical work in data science. Building on the recent developments in Calonico et al (2025) <https://rdpackages.github.io/references/Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell-Palomba-Titiunik_2025_HTERD.pdf>, this package provides tools for estimation and inference of heterogeneous treatment effects in Regression Discontinuity (RD) Designs. The package includes two main commands: 'rdhte' to conduct estimation and robust bias-corrected inference for conditional RD treatment effects (given choice of bandwidth parameter); and 'rdbwhte', which implements automatic bandwidth selection methods.
